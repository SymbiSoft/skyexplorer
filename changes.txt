get the correct private dir for S60 3rd Edition in appDir (default.py)
add Explorer.findApps1 (require applist.pyd - allow S60 3rd Edition)
add AppItem._pname (same as old AppItem.name - the app filename without ext)
  the AppItem.name is initialize with app caption (from findApps1)

(thanks Davide Alberani for reporting unicode filenames bugs [Issue 3])
unicode path should be encoded in utf8 when using S60 os functions
 modify path.join - return in utf8
support unicode filename, search
 dir_util.findFiles - support unicode names, return in unicode
 searchText - support utf_16 files
!? unicode filename is encoded in utf8 when added to zip file
 unzip in S60 seems to work :)
 (unzip in other OS may retain the utf8 encoded name)
support UCS2 sms
explorertag.py - key, value in Tags are saved in utf8
